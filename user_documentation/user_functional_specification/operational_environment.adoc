== User Operational Environment

The administrator can interface with the marketplace application
through terminal/shell commands or third-party utilities (e.g.
phpMyAdmin).

In the future, other parties (e.g. the UX guys) can write some
external libraries to support a graphical user interface to
facilitate adoption (this would not be part of the core
application but it would be a nice option for high level users).

Other users (the developers and the investors) interface with the
platform through the use of a browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, Internet Explorer ...etc).

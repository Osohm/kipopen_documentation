== Features and Requirements
The following is a list of features required for the first
development cycle (add all potential features first, purge/postpone
later):

* Secure user account creation and updates.
* Decentralized secure storage of user credentials: So that users only
have to login through one marketplace.
* Project creation guidance (user docs, tech docs, team selection,
    financial plan, user manual wiki ... etc.)
* Support for project category tags (relevant to product
    development).
* Project Search functionality (local and remote search results)
* Project messaging board.
* Project ownership, rewards and voting rights.
* Decentralized secure storage of all project's info: so they are fully
    searchable from any marketplace in the network.
* Decentralized secure storage of project/developers reviews. So that
    they can be seen and updated from any marketplace (for
    accountability and transparency).
* pluggable architecture to support extra functionality.

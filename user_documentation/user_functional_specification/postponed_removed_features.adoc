== Postponed/Removed Features

These are the ideas that *will not* be implemented, they are
too *bold*, too *outside the box*, so they belong
**outside** of the application, maybe for the next release cycle
(evil laugh), we will keep adding increasing this list continuously
(i.e. simplifying the application to the bone) so that we can meet
our release cycles.

. *The marketplace application will ship out with a really nice looking
    GUI (e.g. a CMS) with all of the bells and whistles.* +
    _No, this will be implemented through external libraries,
    the marketplace application will be the absolute minimal
    application that gets the job done_

. *The application will attract users by lots of animation and pictures
    everywhere.* +
    _No, this is not a marketing fad, the focus will be on content.
    It will follow more of a black and white or gray-scale standard
    (similar to the Wikipedia standard)._

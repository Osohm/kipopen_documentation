Our mission is to provide a viable economic path for
the design and commercialization of open technologies.

Our overall aim is to shift the current economics of the
system to a demand-sided model by directly connecting
informed consumers with technical developers.

_Given the right economics, we see a future where
open is the de-facto standard for consumer products_

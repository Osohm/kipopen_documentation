*The lack of sustainable sources of capital for open projects and Open
Intellectual Property (https://osohm.org/faq/#what-is-open-intellectual-property[OIP])
in general.*

_While the collaborative development model of open projects can be
sound, the economics of the system are weak. Today most open projects
are largely funded by aggregate donations and/or corporate
sponsorships; this is not sustainable in the long term._

____
For widespread adoption of open technology in the consumer market
(not only in niche markets): informed consumers must understand the
value (and the cost) of open technology and engineers and developers
must make a living.
____

The goal of the KipOpen project is to find alternative funding models
that do not rely on donations but on tangible returns for consumers
that can be used as incentives for them to invest on open technology.

*We don't claim to have a solution that solves the funding problem for
every sector of technology; this would be naive.* The funding problem
looks different for every sector and must be tackled by passionate
individuals specializing in those sectors (e.g. it would be futile for
a hardware engineer to expect to solve the problem for open academic
research).

KipOpen is simply a tool that incentivizes individuals from different
technology sectors to find appropriate solutions.

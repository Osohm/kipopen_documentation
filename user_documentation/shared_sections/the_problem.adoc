The lack of sustainable sources of capital for open projects and open
intellectual property (IP) in general. i.e. most open projects are largely
funded by aggregate donations and/or corporate sponsorships; this is
not sustainable in the long term.

NOTE: While the collaborative development model of open projects can be
sound, the economics of the system are very weak.

For widespread adoption of open technology in the consumer market
(not only in niche markets): informed consumers must understand the
value (and the cost) of open technology and engineers and developers
must make a living.

The KipOpen project aims to provide a solution to this problem:
a decentralized crowd-sourcing platform for funding the development of
open products (every stage of the design cycle) by informed consumers.

KipOpen is a web application that anyone can download and install in
their own computer to host an open marketplace (aka community
investment/crowdfunding site). The application comes with the
minimal core functionality required to launch the marketplace (in
small computing devices) and it has a pluggable architecture
to support the addition of extra functionality (e.g. Bitcoin payments
plugin, Facebook/Twitter integration plugin ...etc) if needed.

Peer to peer Communication is essential among all the KipOpen
applications and it allows every marketplace to share
project/developers reviews, user information (so that users don't have
to login multiple times) and projects' information (so that users can
search for any project in the network easily).

Each marketplace application hosts open technology projects and these
generate a profit for the developer(s), a commission for the site's
administrator and a tangible return for the individuals and the
community (an economically viable alternative for all parties).

The long-term goal of the KipOpen application is to provide a completely
open alternative path for the design and development of consumer
products. The general plan is to support every stage of the design
cycle and subsequent manufacturing/production cycles, these stages
define our project categories and include:

* Technology Research.
* Hardware Design.
* Firmware Development.
* Mechanical Design.
* Industrial Design.
* Software Development.
* Manufacturing and Retailing (pre-order based).

Through the use of a community investment platform designed solely for
the development of open technology products, we aim to incentivize the
use of public capital (i.e. from pools of informed consumers) to fund
every stage of the design cycle. This is in contrast to the use of
private venture capital for funding the development of
closed/proprietary technology (which is our current standard) and the
use of popular crowdsourcing sites for funding flashy proprietary
tech products by uninformed or misled consumers.

NOTE: This is a completely decentralized model (as opposed to
the large centralized crowd-sourcing sites). Thus, widespread adoption
relies not on large advertising campaigns but on the correct economic
strategy to incentivize people to host marketplaces and consumers
to trade on them.

IMPORTANT: The KipOpen application will act as a *hub*, i.e. project's
information will *not* be hosted on the site directly, we will try
hard to keep the host servers lightweight. We will maximize the use of
out-links and embedded links (e.g. gitHub/bitBucket for Repos,
Youtube/Vimeo for videos ...etc).

KipOpen is a web application that anyone can download and install in
their own computer to host a crowdfunding site.

Each individual crowdfunding site is part of a decentralized network
where peer to peer communication and a distributed database allows
every marketplace to share project/developers reviews, user credentials
(so that users don't have to login multiple times) and projects'
information (so that users can search for any project in the network
easily).

The application comes with the minimal core functionality required to
operate in small computing devices and it has a pluggable architecture
to support the addition of extra functionality (e.g. Bitcoin payments
plugin, Facebook/Twitter integration plugin, French Language plugin,
research crowdfunding plugin, hardware crowdfunding plugin ...etc).

Each marketplace application hosts open technology projects and these
generate a profit for the developer(s), a commission for the site's
administrator and a tangible return for the individuals and the
community (an economically viable alternative for all parties).

The long-term goal of the KipOpen application is to provide a completely
open alternative path for the design and development of consumer
products. *KipOpen incentivizes individual players (potentially from different
countries) specializing in different market sectors to host
crowdfunding sites specially tailored towards the problem of
funding of open technologies in those sectors*.
For example in a long-term future we would expect crowdfunding sites in
multiple regions and languages specializing in:

* Technology Research.
* Hardware Design.
* Firmware Development.
* Mechanical Design.
* Industrial Design.
* Software Development.
* Manufacturing and Retailing.

Through the use of an investment platform designed solely for
the development of open technology products, we aim to incentivize the
use of public capital (i.e. from pools of informed consumers) to fund
every stage of the design cycle. This is in contrast to the use of
private venture capital for funding the development of
closed/proprietary technology (which is our current standard) and the
use of popular crowdsourcing sites for funding flashy proprietary
tech products by uninformed or misled consumers.

NOTE: This is a completely decentralized model (as opposed to
the large centralized crowd-sourcing sites). Thus, widespread adoption
relies not on large advertising campaigns but on the correct economic
strategy to incentivize people to host marketplaces and consumers
to trade on them.

IMPORTANT: The KipOpen application will act as a *hub*, i.e. project's
information will *not* be hosted on the site directly, we will try
hard to keep the host servers lightweight. We will maximize the use of
out-links and embedded links (e.g. gitHub/bitBucket for Repos,
Youtube/Vimeo for videos ...etc).

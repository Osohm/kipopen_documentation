KipOpen is a web application that anyone can download and install in
their own computer to host an open marketplace.

The host of the marketplace (i.e. the site administrator) can receive
any commissions generated by the site.

Technical users can then use the marketplace site to create open
designs/products and informed consumers can invest and vote on those
designs/products directly.

NOTE: This is a completely decentralized model (as opposed to
the large centralized crowd-sourcing sites). Widespread adoption relies
not on large advertising campaigns but on the correct economic
strategy to incentivize people to host marketplaces and consumers
to trade on them.

IMPORTANT: The KipOpen application will act as a *hub*, i.e. project's
information will *not* be hosted on the site directly, we will try
hard to keep the host servers lightweight. We will maximize the use of
out-links and embedded links (e.g. gitHub/bitBucket for Repos,
Youtube/Vimeo for videos ...etc).

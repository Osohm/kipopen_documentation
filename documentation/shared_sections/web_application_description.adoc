The long-term goal of the KipOpen application is to provide a completely
open alternative path for the design and development of consumer
products. The general plan is to support every stage of the design
cycle and subsequent manufacturing/production cycles, these stages
define our project categories and include:

* Technology Research.
* Hardware Design.
* Firmware Development.
* Mechanical Design.
* Industrial Design.
* Software Development.
* Manufacturing and Retailing (pre-order based).

Through the use of a community investment platform designed solely for
the development of open technology products, we aim to incentivize the
use of public capital (i.e. from pools of informed consumers) to fund
every stage of the design cycle. This is in contrast to the use of
private venture capital for funding the development of
closed/proprietary technology (which is our current standard) and the
use of popular crowdsourcing sites for funding flashy proprietary
tech products by uninformed or misled consumers.

Every project will generate a profit for the developer(s) and a
tangible return (for the individual and the community), thus
guaranteeing an economically viable alternative for both parties.

KipOpen is a web application that anyone can download and install in
their own computer to host an open marketplace (aka community
investment platform/crowdfunding site). The application comes with the
minimal core functionality required to launch the marketplace and run in
small computing devices  but has a pluggable architecture to support the
addition of extra functionality (e.g. Bitcoin payments plugin,
Facebook/Twitter integration plugin ...etc) if needed.

The host of the marketplace (i.e. the site administrator) can receive
any commissions generated by the site.

Technical users can then use the marketplace site to create open
designs/products and informed consumers can invest and vote on those
designs/products directly.

In the future all marketplaces will communicate peer to peer to
share project/developers reviews, provide both local and remote
marketplace search results and share user registration credentials (so
that users don't need to login multiple times).

NOTE: This is a completely decentralized model (as opposed to
the large centralized crowd-sourcing sites). Widespread adoption relies
not on large advertising campaigns but on the correct economic
strategy to incentivize people to host marketplaces and consumers
to trade on them.

IMPORTANT: The KipOpen application will act as a *hub*, i.e. project's
information will *not* be hosted on the site directly, we will try
hard to keep the host servers lightweight. We will maximize the use of
out-links and embedded links (e.g. gitHub/bitBucket for Repos,
Youtube/Vimeo for videos ...etc).

To guarantee the adoption of open technologies at a wide scale,
we need to make sure we have better economic incentives for both
the users as well as for the developers of open technology. In other
words, we need to establish a clear competitive advantage over
closed proprietary technology, ultimately if we want adoption
*We must compete* for market share.

The following economic incentives are in place for every type of user:

KipOpen Site Administrators::
    Receive a commission for every project funded on their marketplace
    (this is pretty standard). This is the incentive they have to
    actually install the web application and host the site in their
    computer (most likely a small single board computer).

KipOpen Consumers (aka Investors)::
    Trade directly with developers and can purchase open goods for a
    fraction of the cost (i.e. there is no corporate, marketing or
    other unnecessary business overhead). By purchasing shares they
    also have the right to vote on the features they want and the level
    of support they need. Consumers are incentivized to invest in open
    technology simply because they get better value.

KipOpen Developers::
    Trade directly with consumers and can now earn money from
    developing open applications. This means that current open
    technology developers now have a choice of working on open designs
    on a full-time basis, furthermore it also means that entrepreneurs
    can start their own company to design complete open products to
    meet the marketplace demand.

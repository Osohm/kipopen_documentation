=== Login/Registration Page

The Login page can be accessed directly through the browser url
(e.g. marketplace.com/login register), or from the navigation bar at
the top of any page. The login/registration page allows people to
register for an account if they donâ€™t have one or login into their
existent account (this is pretty self-explanatory right?).

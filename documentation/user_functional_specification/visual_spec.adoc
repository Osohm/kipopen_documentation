== Visual Specification

This is the screen by screen look of the application.

NOTE: Note that the Home, Login, About Us and FAQ buttons in our
navigation header and footer are common to every page.

IMPORTANT: The visual appearance of our wireframes should be taken only
as a reference, meaning the implementation of every page should adhere
to what is technically simplest (lowest overhead) and possible
(standard practice).

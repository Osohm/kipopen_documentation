== Why decentralized?

A decentralized network is crucial:

* It allows consumers/investors to use and see
KipOpen as a _single investment platform_ (e.g. they only need to login
once and they can search for any project in the network easily).
*This is necessary to facilitate user adoption.*

* It distributes the cost and maintenance of the network over all the
individual crowdfunding sites (i.e. the network nodes).
*This secures the long-term sustainability of the platform.*

* It incentivizes the creation of new crowdfunding sites. Every new
site benefits from being part of the network (e.g. access to
existent users, inclusion in global search results, publicity ...etc)
and faces lower barriers to entry. *This fuels the growth of the network.*

.But most importantly
A decentralized architecture allows the KipOpen platform to grow and
become a self-sustained independent entity. KipOpen can live on
irrelevant of the fate of any particular backing organization.
